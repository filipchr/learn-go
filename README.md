# learn-go

Well, so this is a repo with all the stuff I do to learn Go!

First go to the folder where the project is living  
`cd path/to/folder`

than `go build` to build the project

and last `./learn-go` to start the project

now visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Other routes are  
List all todos: [localhost:8080/todos](http://localhost:8080/todos)  
Show one todo: [localhost:8080/todos/1](http://localhost:8080/todos/1)
